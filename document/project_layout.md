# mini-envoy Project Layout

All re-implemented source code is equally important to
the document. The project folder layout reflects this
understanding, there are two top folders, 'document' and
'mini-envoy'.

'document' contains all design details from the open source
project consideration to the technical document.

'mini-envoy' consists of source code files, test scripts,
compiling charts ... that making up a envoy proxy.
